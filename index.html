    <h2>BOX</h2>
    <h4>2016 - 2019</h4>

      <p>I started at BOX in the position of Kitchen Manager, working under the chef there, but eventually also took on the position of chef after she moved to another state. While running the BOX kitchen I was responsible for scheduling the cooks, placing food orders, organizing the kitchen, coming up with recipes for daily specials on the fly, executing the main menu items that were in place when I was hired, and then also helping design the following menu with based on notes from our VP of the campany.

  <h2>Little Octopus</h2>
  <h4>2014-2016</h4>
  <section>
    <p>I started at Little Octopus as line cook, but it was my first real experience in fine dining and working for an accomplished noteworthy chef. I learned to execute many dishes in the style of Carribean fusion. This is where I truly learned to cook. I learned so many aspects of culinary method in an environment with very high standards, worked in an open kitchen, and cooked for celebrities like Derek Henry and Cameron Diaz. </p>

  <h2>South Music and Sound Design</h2>
  <h4>2009 - 2010</h4>
  <section>
    <p>At South I worked as a commercial staff writer on projects that provided original music for televison shows, film, and tv commercials, and video games. I was responsible for composing three to six original music pieces a day, usually written as music beds for television commercials. I also had to produce, record, perform the parts, and mix the tracks I wrote without any outside assistance. I won placements for commercials made by Dominoes Pizza, Chevy, Ford, Subaru, and even a public service announcement featuring Justin Timberlake, Pink, Swizz Beats, and Usher. All our projects had quick turn around and hard deadlines causing me to learn how to be creative musically under a different kind of pressure than previously experienced. </p>
